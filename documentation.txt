Health Advisor Chatbot Documentation

This documentation provides an overview of the Health Advisor chatbot code, which is designed to assist users with health-related information and provide basic user profile functionality.

1. Introduction:
The Health Advisor chatbot is an AI-powered application that interacts with users and responds to health-related queries. It also allows users to create a basic user profile for emergency purposes.

2. Requirements:
- Python 3.9>>> recommended
- Required libraries: textbase, difflib (install using 'pip install textbase difflib')

3. Setup:
- Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed.
- Replace "YOUR_API_KEY" with your actual OpenAI API key.
- Create a file named "health_keywords.txt" with health-related keywords, each on a new line.

4. Features:
- Greeting Prompt: The chatbot responds to greetings and prompts users to ask health-related questions.
- Health-Related Responses: The chatbot generates health-related responses using the OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo model.
- Non-Health Responses: If the input is not health-related, the chatbot informs the user.
- User Profiles: Users can create a basic user profile with their name, contact details, and medical history.
- Emergency Notification: An emergency notification mechanism is not implemented in this version but can be added in the future.

5. How to Use:
- Run the script using 'python script_name.py'.
- Start the chat with a greeting or a health-related question.
- Provide input, and the chatbot will respond based on the input.

6. Chatbot Behavior:
- The chatbot will recognize common greetings and prompt users to ask health-related questions.
- If input is health-related, the chatbot generates relevant responses using the GPT-3.5 Turbo model.
- If input is not health-related, the chatbot informs the user that it can't help with non-health queries.

7. User Profiles:
- The script supports the creation of user profiles for emergency purposes.
- User profiles are stored in the 'user_profiles' dictionary within the script.
- Use the 'create_user_profile' function to create a new user profile with name, contact details, and medical history.

8. Additional Functionality (Not Implemented):
- Emergency Notification: A future enhancement could include a notification mechanism to alert doctors or healthcare professionals about user emergencies.

9. Disclaimer:
This chatbot is intended for informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice. Users should consult a healthcare professional for personalized medical guidance.
